Angels Hello-World Job
I am a 33 Yro male that has absolutely no idea how to use github.  
I love my truck and racing sport bikes; my daily rider is a 2012 GSX-R 600 with full race exhaust PC-5 tuner.  
My track bike is a 2006 GSX-R 600 with PC-3 and full race plastics.  
I have two daughters 7 & 9 who are my life and I hope I can pull off this job so they will never have to know what it means to be broke.
LOL. J/K no not really, i'm really worried.  
I love to hunt and shoot and thats about it for now. :-)
